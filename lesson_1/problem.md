1 - Create a form where the user must input:
- First name
- Last name
- email
- content

2 - Add a button with the text "Submit"

Tips:
- attribute values cannot have spaces. Example `id="this does not work"` vs. `id="this_will_work"`
- try to use the best *type* for each input.
- try to add a new HTML element for the "content" input. This element should allow for the user to add really long text.

Good luck! :)
