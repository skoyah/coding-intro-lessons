The basic building blocks in HTML are **elements**.
  
An element is represented by a **tag**.
  
The way you write element tags is, for example for a paragraph:

`<p>This is a paragraph</p>`

Most elements have an opening tag (where the tag name goes between `<` and  `>`), and also a a closing tag (where the tag name is between `</` and  `>`),

Elements can also have **attributes**. Tehy can be included in elements like so:
`<input type="text" id="email_input">`

In the previous example, the *input* element has **2** attributes, a *type* attribute with the value o *text* and a **id** attribute with the value of *email_input*
